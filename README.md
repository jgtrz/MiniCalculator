# MiniCalculator
The MiniCalculator class inherits from the Calculator class, which implements the Divider and Multiplier interfaces.
The UnitTests class tests the methods in the MiniCalculator class.
  The class tests the multiply, divide and calculate methods.
  For the multiply method the class tests the multiplication of both positive and negative numbers,large numbers, and calling the method multiple times.
  For the divide method the class tests the division of both positive and negative numbers, large numbers, numbers with expected result less than one as well as numbers with expected result more than one, and finally it tests for trying to divide by zero.
  For the calculate method the class only tests that is returns the value of the 'total' field.
